### Tips
* Definitely write the rationales for the decisions you make concerning methods to use, deviations from protocols, etc.
* Write the rationales in the manuscript in defence of such decisions and design.
* Make sure you solidify and finalize the methods of gaining data, assessing data, and representing data PRIOR to commencing the collection, ESPECIALLY the third-party analysis or collection.
